A breakpoint is a point at which the debugger should stop executing code, and return control to the user with a ```prompt>```.

phpdbg supports many different forms of breakpoint, among them:

  - line              - break on the given line of the currently executing file
  - file:line         - break on the given line of the specified file
  - function          - break on entrance to function()
  - class::method     - break on entrance to class::method()
    
These, and other supported break points, allow the user to be specific about where phpdbg should interrupt execution.

Let us start an example debugging session on the file ```a.php```. 

We want this file below to output `beginning of minute` in the first 30 seconds, then `end of minute` in the last 30 seconds.

    <?php
    function mode ($m) {
        if ($m == 0) {
            return "beginning";
        } else {
            return "end";
        }
    }
    
    $second = time() % 60;
    $mode = mode(round($second / 30)); // line 11

    print "$mode of minute";
    ?>
    
But, we seem to get only "beginning" for the first 15 seconds. That is not what we expected!

We maybe should break before the call to the function `mode` to see what the value of `$second` is.

Then start a simple debugger session:

    phpdbg a.php
    prompt> b 11
    [Breakpoint #0 added at /Users/Bob/php-src-5.6/a.php:11]
    prompt> r
    [Breakpoint #0 at /Users/Bob/php-src-5.6/a.php:11, hits: 1]
    >00011:     $mode = mode(round($second / 30));
     00012: 
     00013:     print "$mode of minute";
    prompt> ev $second
    20
     
So far, everything seems normal: `$second` is between 16 and 29. Next, let us inspect the parameters passed to `mode`. `Step` forward, so that we can inspect the value of `$m`. `Step` means that we continue execution of the script until we reach the next line. In this case, we step twice forward until the body of the function â€” until `$m` has been fetched.

    prompt> step
    [L11         0x101527ac8 ZEND_SEND_VAL                  @0                   <unused>             <unused>             /a.php]
    [L11         0x101527af8 ZEND_DO_FCALL                  C4                   <unused>             @1                   /a.php]
    [L11         0x101527b28 ZEND_SEND_VAR_NO_REF           @1                   <unused>             <unused>             /a.php]
    [L11         0x101527b58 ZEND_DO_FCALL                  C5                   <unused>             @2                   /a.php]
    [L2          0x101498bf8 ZEND_RECV                      <unused>             <unused>             $m                   /a.php]
    >00002:     function mode ($m) {
     00003:         if ($m == 0) {
     00004:             return "beginning";
    prompt> step
    [L3          0x101498c28 ZEND_IS_EQUAL                  $m                   C0                   @0                   /a.php]
    >00003:         if ($m == 0) {
     00004:             return "beginning";
     00005:         } else {
    prompt> ev $m
    1

The value of `$m` is `1`? We expected `0` for `round($second / 30)` when `$second` is `20`:  Seems to be we have used `round` instead of `floor`:

    prompt> ev $m = floor(20 / 30)
    0

Now everything should work again. Remove the breakpoint (so that we will not hit it again) with `break del 0` - the `0` being the breakpoint id. Look above:

    [Breakpoint #0 added at /Users/Bob/php-src-5.6/a.php:11]

`#0` denotes the breakpoint id.

    prompt> break del 0
    [Deleted breakpoint #0]

Finally, just run the code until it ends, with `continue`. It should print now `beginning of minute` because `$m` is now `0`.

    prompt> c
    beginning of minute
    [Script ended normally]

Great, everything works now like expected.

*Note: we didn't type command in full in the last example; phpdbg commands support abbreviations*

A quick list of commands we know so far:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Command</th><th>Shortcut</th><th>Action</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>run</td><td>r</td><td>Starts execution of the script</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ev</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>Evaluates an expression</td></tr>
        <tr><td>break</td><td>b</td><td>Inserts a breakpoint</td></tr>
        <tr><td>break del</td><td>b d</td><td>Deletes a breakpoint by id</td></tr>
        <tr><td>continue</td><td>c</td><td>Continues code execution until next breakpoint</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
